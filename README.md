# FlipperZero3dModel

This is a 3d model of the Flipper Zero I made in blender

The model is all made by me and I used a few free textures from BlenderKit to make the table and modified one for the Flipper plastic

To open the blend file you need the linked assets, the stl is not the full scene, because it's made for printing, and the booleans would've messed it up. There's also a random image of a Flipper Zero in the bg of the blender file I was using as reference and I figured nobody wants that in the stl.
